## Status

This project is currently under construction. But it's semi working!

## Usage

It works as a set of extensionmethods but will also get support of static methods (dynamic does not allow extensionmethods).

	.Dump() // To console by default
	.Dump(<depth>)
	.Dump(<depth>, <TextWriter>)

	.DumpAsHtml() // Returns HTML string as default
	.DumpAsHtml(<depth>)
	.DumpAsHtml(<depth>, <TextWriter>)

## Example in a razor view:

	@ViewData.ModelMetadata.DumpAsHtml(4)
