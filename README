This project is currently under construction. But it's semi working!

Usage

It works as a set of extensionmethods but will also get support of static methods (dynamic does not allow extensionmethods).
.Dump() // To console default
.Dump(<depth>)
.Dump(<depth>, <TextWriter>)

.DumpAsHtml() // Returns HTML data as default
.DumpAsHtml(<depth>)
.DumpAsHtml(<depth>, <TextWriter>)

Example in a razor view:

ViewData.ModelMetadata.DumpAsHtml(4)
